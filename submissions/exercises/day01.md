#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer:Shopee was easier to navigate and pleasing to look and understand for typical user. It was organized per section. The color compliment the text and product.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: For Lazada (desktop edition) -> The color white background makes my headache to look at i wish it was more on in between white and grey or they could've made the product in box frame so we could separate them in the bg. The heading tab color become unnoticeable since the color was same in bg. I jst hope they would change their color scheme to become pleasing and easier to scroll for user. 

    -> The text has a huge difference than shopee, the spacing per text and the font was not giving HAHAHA. The product names on Lazada are crowded by additional texts like "12.12", "LazMall", and "LazTap", which makes it repetitive and overwhelming. Shopee, on the other hand, uses a mall sticker to highlight local brands instead of cluttering the product name.

    -> Lazada has an issue with information overload in certain sections, like "Related search" and "Hot search", which are unnecessary distractions for users. Additionally, the definition that shows up every time you search a product takes up unnecessary space. It would be better to remove these elements to streamline the user experience.

    For Shopee (Desktop)
    ->In terms of convenience, it would be beneficial if Shopee's search bar stays visible or on the side while scrolling, so users don't have to scroll up to search for another product again.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee is much simpler and user-friendly in terms of navigation as it displays distinct categories with clear logos representing each specific category. In contrast, Lazada relies solely on textual descriptions, which may be less efficient for certain users. I strongly believe that graphical symbols are far more effective in instantly locating desired items.


<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: -> Lazada: The Lazada webesite has a clean and professional design. For me the layout was lacking something but for some it preferred to be visually appealing and consistent with their brand. The color scheme of the website reflect a modern and sleek look 
    
    -> Shopee: The Shopee has a visually pleasing website design. The layout is user-friendly and has a fun and vibrant look compared to lazada. Shopee's design is consistent with their brand image, which aims to create an engaging and interactive shopping experience.

    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer: -> Lazada: The Lazada website is generally responsive and works well on various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. However, there may be occasional issues with loading speed or resizing elements on certain devices.

    ->Shopee: Shopee's website is known for its responsiveness across different devices. It is designed to work seamlessly on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The interface adjusts well to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience.

    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: In terms of the visual aspect, it is subjective to personal preference.For me, shopee ez HAHAHA. Some users may find Lazada's more professional and visually appealing design to be better, while others may prefer Shopee's more vibrant and interactive design. Ultimately, it depends on individual tastes and preferences.
